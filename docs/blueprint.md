# **App Name**: AccessGuard

## Core Features:

- Boundary Settings UI: Implement UI for setting access boundaries (time, date, number of views).
- Priority Order UI: UI for prioritizing access order among users.
- Time-based Access Control: Enforce time-based access rules (e.g., 8-9pm, 1-day access).
- View Limit Control: Limit access based on the number of views.
- User Specific Access: Allow/disallow access to specific users, acting as a tool for identity validation.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sky Blue (#87CEEB) to evoke trust and security.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), nearly white, for a clean interface.
- Accent color: Coral (#FF7F50) to draw attention to settings and important controls; it contrasts nicely with the primary blue.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for clean and accessible readability.
- Use clear, simple icons to represent different access settings (e.g., clock for time limits, person for user-specific access).
- Prioritize a clean and intuitive layout, making it easy for users to find and adjust access settings. The access boundaries configurations need to be extremely accessible to improve the User Experience.
